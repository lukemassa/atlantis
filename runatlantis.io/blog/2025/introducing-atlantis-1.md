The core team is excited to announce the release of Atlantis 1.0.0! This release is many years in the making, and we're excited to be bringing Atlantis

## Questions

### What should we expect from this release?

We don't expect 1.0.0 to be any different than any of our "minor" releases starting with `0`. It's merely an indication that we believe the product is stable enough to warrant 1.0.0 release.

### When do we expect Atlantis 2.0.0?

There are no immediate plans to release Atlantis 2.0.0, nor do we think it will never happen. We are roughly following semver guidelines described [here](https://semver.org/), which note that the major version should be incremented if "backward incompatible changes are introduced to the public API". (TODO: What does that mean for Atlantis?). If that ever happens, we reserve the right to release Atlantis 2.0.0. But releasing 1.0.0 is an indication of our commitment to stability and maintaining backwards compatibility.

### How will we decide whether to increment major, minor, or patch for a given release?
